# :rabbit: WhiteRabbit, a CHIP8 Emulator for Automation and Agents
## Down the rabbit-hole
As I was sitting near my computer one hot summer day, I was considering in my own mind whether the pleasure of coding another agent to auto-play a Mario minigame would be worth the trouble of determining the pixel-perfect location for the emulator to allow the agent to collect viable screenshots, when suddenly a White Rabbit ran close by me.           

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did I think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"; but when the Rabbit actually took out an emulator that could directly communicate with agents, I started to my feet, for it flashed across my mind that I had never seen an emulator interface directly with Python scripts and thus not require complete control of the screen, keyboard, and mouse, and burning with curiosity, I ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

## So what is WhiteRabbit?
It's a CHIP8 emulator with a TCP/IP Server written in C++ using the Qt framework. It looks like this!

## What can it do?
The emulator can ...     
üéÆ Run any uploaded CHIP8 game          
‚è≤Ô∏è Adjust the speed of the game execution      
‚èØÔ∏è Play/pause the game      
‚Ü©Ô∏è Reset the game     

The server can connect to clients and send ...              
‚û°Ô∏è üì∫ On-screen display from the emulator (No need to continuously screenshot your screen to get visual input!)               
‚û°Ô∏è üéπ Pressed and released keys from the CHIP8 keyboard         
‚û°Ô∏è üéµ Get sound status       

The server can receive from the connected clients ...     
‚¨ÖÔ∏è üéπ CHIP8 keyboard commands (press or release a key) and relays information to the emulator (No need to have the agent take control of the keyboard to play the game!)         
‚¨ÖÔ∏è üñºÔ∏è Publish images to the emulator GUI          
‚¨ÖÔ∏è üìú Publish text to the emulator GUI            

## White Rabbit Chip8 (Chip-8 Program)
Now you might be wondering what that cool-looking rabbit with a watch is at the top left of the program. It's an interactive program I've written in the Chip-8 language where upon pressing the "A" key (either on the displayed keyboard or via request through the server), the rabbit vanishes! Don't worry; releasing the "A" key will bring it back.    
Its purpose? To welcome you üê∞              

## Demo Client (Python Script)
Additionally, I've written a script in Python that demonstrates how to connect to the WhiteRabbit server, as well as send and receive requests.      
The script proceeds in the following manner:       
1Ô∏è‚É£ Connects to the server       
2Ô∏è‚É£ Publishes "Hello There!" to the console (lower right of the program screen)          
3Ô∏è‚É£ Requests a screen capture of the CHIP8 display         
4Ô∏è‚É£ Upscales & blurs the received image and then publishes it to the dedicated image spot at the top right of the program             
5Ô∏è‚É£ Publishes the request to press the "A" key, causing the rabbit to disappear            
6Ô∏è‚É£ Requests the CHIP8 keyboard information; the "A" key is registered as being pressed           
7Ô∏è‚É£ Publishes the request to release the "A" key; the rabbit is back         

Location of the script: WhiteRabbit/scripts subfolder

## Server Requests 
Ah! I see you ventured this far into the rabbit hole, perchance you have an agent/automation project in mind? üëÄ The following information shall prove useful then.  
### Server Info
**Server IP**: 127.0.0.1               
**Port Number**: 3000                 
**QDataStream Version**: Qt_5_12               

### GET_CHIP8_INFO
**Function**: Gets the state of keyboard keys and if the emulator is beeping             
```
'{"request": "GET_CHIP8_INFO"}'
```
**Output**: JSON string, where if a key is marked as 'true', then it is currently being pressed            
```
Output example:
{
    "is_beeping": false,
    "key_0": false,
    "key_1": false,
    "key_2": false,
    "key_3": false,
    "key_4": false,
    "key_5": false,
    "key_6": false,
    "key_7": false,
    "key_8": false,
    "key_9": false,
    "key_A": true,
    "key_B": false,
    "key_C": false,
    "key_D": false,
    "key_E": false,
    "key_F": false
}
```
### GET_SCREEN_CAPTURE
**Function**: Gets the display information of the CHIP8 emulator             
```
'{"request": "GET_SCREEN_CAPTURE"}'
```
**Output**: A QByteArray of length 2048, where a \x00 indicates a black pixel and \x01 a white one. The output must be reshaped to the CHIP8 screen dimensions of [32x64]                   
```
Output example:
b'\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\ ... truncated ... \x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00'
```

### PUBLISH_TEXT
**Function**: Displays YOUR_TEXT to the WhiteRabbit text console             
**Input**: text (YOUR_TEXT as your desired message)                
```
'{"request": "PUBLISH_TEXT","text": "YOUR_TEXT"}'
```

### PUBLISH_COMMAND
**Function**: The equivalent of pressing/releasing a key on the keyboard             
**Input**: 
* command_key (YOUR_KEY as either a number 0-9 or a letter A-F, depending on the key)
* command_action (either PRESS or RELEASE depending on the desired action)                 
```
'{"request": "PUBLISH_COMMAND","command_key": "YOUR_KEY","command_action": "PRESS|RELEASE"}'
```
### PUBLISH_IMAGE
**Function**: Displays YOUR_IMAGE to the WhiteRabbit client image location

```
'{"request": "PUBLISH_IMAGE","image": "YOUR_IMAGE"}'
```

### Server received request
To indicate that the WhiteRabbit server has received the request (in the cases where it doesn't have to send back any data), it will reply with a rabbit smile.
