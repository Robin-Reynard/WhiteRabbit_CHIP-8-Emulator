# :rabbit: WhiteRabbit, a CHIP8 Emulator for Automation and Agents
As I was sitting near my computer one hot summer day, I was considering in my own mind whether the pleasure of coding another agent to auto-play a Mario minigame would be worth the trouble of determining the pixel-perfect location for the emulator onscreen to collect viable screenshots and losing access to my computer's mouse and keys to the monopolizing agent, when suddently a White Rabbit ran close by me.           

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did I think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"; but when the Rabbit actually took out an emulator that could directly communicate with agents, I started to my feet, for it flashed my mind that I had never seen an emulator interface directly with Python scripts and thus not require complete control of screen, keyboard, and mouse, and burning with curiosity, I ran accross the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
